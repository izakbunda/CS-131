(* Russell's Paradox involves asking whether a set is a member of itself. 
   Write a function self_member s that returns true iff the set represented by s is a member of itself, 
   and explain in a comment why your function is correct; or, if it's not possible to write such a function in OCaml, 
   explain why not in a comment. *)
