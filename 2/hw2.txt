Parser is like basically a special version of a matcher that ALWAYS ONLY uses an acceptor like accept_empty_suffix which
only accepts an empty suffix []. So it makes more sense to me to create the matcher first.
This is the main difference since both matcher and parser also share the use of a fragment.
