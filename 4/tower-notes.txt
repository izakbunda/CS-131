| ?- ambiguous(N, C, T1, T2).

C = counts([4,2,2,1],[1,2,2,4],[4,2,2,1],[1,2,2,4])
N = 4
T1 = [[1,2,3,4],[2,1,4,3],[3,4,1,2],[4,3,2,1]]
T2 = [[1,2,3,4],[2,4,1,3],[3,1,4,2],[4,3,2,1]] 

This is ambiguous beacause the constraints let us arrange the towers within the grid without
violating the visibility or uniqueness (sudokuness) requirements. Basically, we can rearrange
this and get multiple valid solutions.
